                        I enjoy reading about history whenever I have the time. Learning about the past intrigues me and gives me a deeper understanding of how the world arrived at this point.

                        Football is a highly tactical sport. Like Chess, you need to be intelligent in order to find success.

                        I got into the sport in 2022 and have been a Bayern Munich fan ever since.
