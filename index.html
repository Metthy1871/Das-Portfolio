                        I love playing all sorts of video games and immersing myself in rich and compelling worlds.
                        I usually play strategy games like Hearts of Iron 4 and Europa Universalis 4, turn-based games like Pokemon and Persona, and story-based games like Final Fantasy.

                    <p>
                        I enjoy reading about history whenever I have the time. Learning about the past intrigues me and gives me a deeper understanding of how the world arrived at this point.
                        I usually read about the Napoleonic era, Pax Brittanica, and the World Wars.

                    <p>
                        I find Chess very enjoyable and challenging. The mental composure and craftiness needed to win has taught me the importance of strong planning and preparation.
                        I'm only rated around 1300 on Chess.com, not great but I find the game fun even when I lose.

                    <p>
                        Programming allows me to practice and apply my problem solving skills. It allows me to bring my project ideas to life by developing applications.
                        I also find it fun to learn how the various programming languages implement core coding concepts.

                    <p>
                        Contrary to how it may seem, Football is a highly tactical sport. Like Chess, you need to be intelligent in order to find success. 
                        I often watch professional games and play FIFA since I enjoy the tactical part of the sport. I got into the sport in 2023 and have been a Bayern Munich fan ever since.

                        It's hard not to be interested in technology when it forms the backbone of modern society. My favorite historical topics to read about is the development
                        of new technologies that revolutionize how the people of the time live their lives.
